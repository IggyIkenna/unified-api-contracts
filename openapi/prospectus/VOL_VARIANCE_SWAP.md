# Strategy Prospectus: Vol Variance Swap

> **Archetype ID**: `VOL_VARIANCE_SWAP`  
> **Family**: `VOL_TRADING`  
> **Status** (codex): design  
> **Alpha disclosure**: full (debugging mode) — no client-facing curtailment applied.

## 1. What It Does + How It Makes Decisions

**[MACHINE-DERIVED]** Family: `VOL_TRADING` | Primary venue categories: not registered

**[MACHINE-DERIVED]** Capability cells: `not_registered` — archetype not in ARCHETYPE_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY

**[CODEX-DERIVED]** From `codex/09-strategy/architecture-v2/archetypes/`:

Replicates a synthetic variance swap position via a static strip of options across all available strikes, combined with
continuous delta-hedging. The variance swap payoff is `(RV² - strike_variance²) × vega_notional / 2`, where
`strike_variance` is the fair variance (vol-squared) at entry. A long variance position profits if realised variance
exceeds implied; short position profits if realised variance is below implied. The log-contract replication approach
requires holding options at every available strike in proportion to `1/K²`, with the full strip delta-hedged daily.
Deribit provides sufficient strike breadth for BTC and ETH to approximate the theoretical continuous strip closely.

## 2. Universe & Execution

**[CODEX-DERIVED]** Venue universe (from doc frontmatter): DERIBIT

**[MACHINE-DERIVED]** Available execution algorithms: Adaptive Twap, Almgren Chriss, Hybrid Optimal, Passive Aggressive Hybrid, Pov Dynamic, Twap, Vwap

> **[MACHINE-DERIVED — GAP]** Order semantics (TIF/FOK/IOC/post-only, ref-pricing modes, multi-leg delta ownership): `not_registered` — VENUE_ORDER_SEMANTICS registry is honest-empty (Phase 2 backfill pending). See gap tracker: `plans/active/issues/capability_wizard_gap_discovery_2026_06_11.md`.

## 3. Exposures & Normalization

> **[MACHINE-DERIVED — FINDING F-CLASS: GAP]** No declared exposure-normalization model found for this archetype. Staked-vs-spot equivalence (e.g. stETH/ETH delta-adjusted exposure), base-currency-neutral views, and intra-leg netting rules are `not_registered` in any UAC registry. Gap tracker: `plans/active/issues/capability_wizard_gap_discovery_2026_06_11.md` — `AGENT P1: Exposure normalization location: staked-ETH vs ETH equivalence`.

## Leg Structure

**[GAP — no leg structure]** This archetype has no entry in `ARCHETYPE_LEG_STRUCTURES` yet, so its structural per-leg restrictions (roles, per-leg instrument types, per-leg venue eligibility, conditional constraints) are not modelled — only the flat `(asset_group, instrument_type)` capability cells above apply. Tracked as a leg-truth gap (F22).

## 4. Fund Flow

**[MACHINE-DERIVED]** Wallets and venues keyed by venue categories + TREASURY_SPLIT_POLICIES (DeFi 20/80, CeFi 0/100, Sports no-split). Staked-basis leg structure derived from archetype family + capability cells.

## 5. Risk & Circuit Breakers

**[MACHINE-DERIVED]** KillSwitchReason set (from UAC `enums.KillSwitchReason`):

- `COINTEGRATION_BREAKDOWN`
- `DAILY_LOSS_BREACH`
- `DATA_STALE`
- `DISABLED`
- `GREEK_LIMIT_BREACH`
- `KILL_SWITCH_TRIGGERED`
- `MAX_DRAWDOWN_BREACH`
- `VENUE_UNAVAILABLE`

**[MACHINE-DERIVED]** RiskGateLayer placement (from UAC `enums.RiskGateLayer`):

- `EXECUTION_PRETRADE`: Execution service pre-trade validation (order sizing, notional caps)
- `RISK_PREFLIGHT`: Risk service pre-flight validation (per-instruction, before execution queue)
- `STRATEGY_SELF_CHECK`: Strategy checks pre-instruction emit (position/PnL/delta guards)
- `VENUE_SIDE`: Venue-side limits (margin checks, open-order limits — external)

## 6. Performance

> **No backtest metrics recorded for this archetype configuration.** Run Phase 5 backtest-on-demand (`strategy_service/engine/backtest/runner.py` over historical data) to generate metrics.

**NEVER invented numbers are shown here** — this section is honest about the absence.

When backtest results are available, the following metric set will be reported (from `unified_trading_library.performance_metrics`):

- `DAYS_PER_YEAR`
