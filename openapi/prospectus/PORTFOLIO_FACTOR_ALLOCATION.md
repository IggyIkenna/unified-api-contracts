# Strategy Prospectus: Portfolio Factor Allocation

> **Archetype ID**: `PORTFOLIO_FACTOR_ALLOCATION`  
> **Family**: `PORTFOLIO`  
> **Status** (codex): design  
> **Alpha disclosure**: full (debugging mode) — no client-facing curtailment applied.

## 1. What It Does + How It Makes Decisions

**[MACHINE-DERIVED]** Family: `PORTFOLIO` | Primary venue categories: not registered

**[MACHINE-DERIVED]** Capability cells: `not_registered` — archetype not in ARCHETYPE_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY

**[CODEX-DERIVED]** From `codex/09-strategy/architecture-v2/archetypes/`:

Factor-exposure allocation: declares target loadings on systemic factors (carry / momentum / vol / size / quality),
allocates equity to child strategies whose realised factor exposures best match the target. Used for mandate-driven
sleeves where the operator must maintain specific factor tilts (e.g. "40% carry exposure, 30% momentum, 30% vol
premium").

Unlike risk parity (minimise risk concentration) or multi-strategy (fixed weights), factor allocation optimises for a
specific **factor profile** — it allocates more equity to children that efficiently load on the target factors, and less
to children with redundant or off-mandate exposures.

**[CODEX-DERIVED]** Execution semantics:

Identical to `PORTFOLIO_MULTI_STRATEGY` — emits `AllocationDirective` only, no direct `TRADE` instructions.

**[CODEX-DERIVED]** Configurable parameters:

````yaml

## 2. Universe & Execution

**[MACHINE-DERIVED]** Available execution algorithms: Adaptive Twap, Almgren Chriss, Hybrid Optimal, Passive Aggressive Hybrid, Pov Dynamic, Twap, Vwap

> **[MACHINE-DERIVED — GAP]** Order semantics (TIF/FOK/IOC/post-only, ref-pricing modes, multi-leg delta ownership): `not_registered` — VENUE_ORDER_SEMANTICS registry is honest-empty (Phase 2 backfill pending). See gap tracker: `plans/active/issues/capability_wizard_gap_discovery_2026_06_11.md`.

## 3. Exposures & Normalization

> **[MACHINE-DERIVED — FINDING F-CLASS: GAP]** No declared exposure-normalization model found for this archetype. Staked-vs-spot equivalence (e.g. stETH/ETH delta-adjusted exposure), base-currency-neutral views, and intra-leg netting rules are `not_registered` in any UAC registry. Gap tracker: `plans/active/issues/capability_wizard_gap_discovery_2026_06_11.md` — `AGENT P1: Exposure normalization location: staked-ETH vs ETH equivalence`.

## 4. Fund Flow

**[MACHINE-DERIVED]** Wallets and venues keyed by venue categories + TREASURY_SPLIT_POLICIES (DeFi 20/80, CeFi 0/100, Sports no-split). Staked-basis leg structure derived from archetype family + capability cells.

## 5. Risk & Circuit Breakers

**[MACHINE-DERIVED]** KillSwitchReason set (from UAC `enums.KillSwitchReason`):

- `COINTEGRATION_BREAKDOWN`
- `DAILY_LOSS_BREACH`
- `DATA_STALE`
- `DISABLED`
- `GREEK_LIMIT_BREACH`
- `KILL_SWITCH_TRIGGERED`
- `MAX_DRAWDOWN_BREACH`
- `VENUE_UNAVAILABLE`

**[MACHINE-DERIVED]** RiskGateLayer placement (from UAC `enums.RiskGateLayer`):

- `EXECUTION_PRETRADE`: Execution service pre-trade validation (order sizing, notional caps)
- `RISK_PREFLIGHT`: Risk service pre-flight validation (per-instruction, before execution queue)
- `STRATEGY_SELF_CHECK`: Strategy checks pre-instruction emit (position/PnL/delta guards)
- `VENUE_SIDE`: Venue-side limits (margin checks, open-order limits — external)

**[CODEX-DERIVED]** Configurable risk parameters (from config schema):

- `max_child_weight: 0.50`
- `min_active_fraction: 0.5`
- `min_child_weight: 0.05`

## 6. Performance

> **No backtest metrics recorded for this archetype configuration.** Run Phase 5 backtest-on-demand (`strategy_service/engine/backtest/runner.py` over historical data) to generate metrics.

**NEVER invented numbers are shown here** — this section is honest about the absence.

Metric set: `unified_trading_library.performance_metrics` defines the canonical metric surface (expected: Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, CAGR, Sortino, Calmar, win rate, avg trade PnL). Import was unavailable on this host.
