# Strategy Prospectus: Vol Term Structure Arb

> **Archetype ID**: `VOL_TERM_STRUCTURE_ARB`  
> **Family**: `VOL_TRADING`  
> **Status** (codex): design  
> **Alpha disclosure**: full (debugging mode) — no client-facing curtailment applied.

## 1. What It Does + How It Makes Decisions

**[MACHINE-DERIVED]** Family: `VOL_TRADING` | Primary venue categories: not registered

**[MACHINE-DERIVED]** Capability cells: `not_registered` — archetype not in ARCHETYPE_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY

**[CODEX-DERIVED]** From `codex/09-strategy/architecture-v2/archetypes/`:

Exploits mispricings along the volatility term structure by simultaneously buying vol at an underpriced tenor and
selling vol at an overpriced tenor on the same underlying. The calendar spread is implemented via options at two expiry
dates, isolating the term structure bet from outright directional vol exposure. The signal compares the current term
structure slope (near IV / far IV ratio) against its rolling historical norm: a flat or inverted structure (front cheap
relative to back) signals a buy-front / sell-back entry expecting re-steepening; a steep structure signals sell-front /
buy-back expecting flattening. Profit is earned when the term structure shape normalises toward its historical average.

## 2. Universe & Execution

**[CODEX-DERIVED]** Venue universe (from doc frontmatter): CBOE, DERIBIT

**[MACHINE-DERIVED]** Available execution algorithms: Adaptive Twap, Almgren Chriss, Hybrid Optimal, Passive Aggressive Hybrid, Pov Dynamic, Twap, Vwap

> **[MACHINE-DERIVED — GAP]** Order semantics (TIF/FOK/IOC/post-only, ref-pricing modes, multi-leg delta ownership): `not_registered` — VENUE_ORDER_SEMANTICS registry is honest-empty (Phase 2 backfill pending). See gap tracker: `plans/active/issues/capability_wizard_gap_discovery_2026_06_11.md`.

## 3. Exposures & Normalization

> **[MACHINE-DERIVED — FINDING F-CLASS: GAP]** No declared exposure-normalization model found for this archetype. Staked-vs-spot equivalence (e.g. stETH/ETH delta-adjusted exposure), base-currency-neutral views, and intra-leg netting rules are `not_registered` in any UAC registry. Gap tracker: `plans/active/issues/capability_wizard_gap_discovery_2026_06_11.md` — `AGENT P1: Exposure normalization location: staked-ETH vs ETH equivalence`.

## 4. Fund Flow

**[MACHINE-DERIVED]** Wallets and venues keyed by venue categories + TREASURY_SPLIT_POLICIES (DeFi 20/80, CeFi 0/100, Sports no-split). Staked-basis leg structure derived from archetype family + capability cells.

## 5. Risk & Circuit Breakers

**[MACHINE-DERIVED]** KillSwitchReason set (from UAC `enums.KillSwitchReason`):

- `COINTEGRATION_BREAKDOWN`
- `DAILY_LOSS_BREACH`
- `DATA_STALE`
- `DISABLED`
- `GREEK_LIMIT_BREACH`
- `KILL_SWITCH_TRIGGERED`
- `MAX_DRAWDOWN_BREACH`
- `VENUE_UNAVAILABLE`

**[MACHINE-DERIVED]** RiskGateLayer placement (from UAC `enums.RiskGateLayer`):

- `EXECUTION_PRETRADE`: Execution service pre-trade validation (order sizing, notional caps)
- `RISK_PREFLIGHT`: Risk service pre-flight validation (per-instruction, before execution queue)
- `STRATEGY_SELF_CHECK`: Strategy checks pre-instruction emit (position/PnL/delta guards)
- `VENUE_SIDE`: Venue-side limits (margin checks, open-order limits — external)

## 6. Performance

> **No backtest metrics recorded for this archetype configuration.** Run Phase 5 backtest-on-demand (`strategy_service/engine/backtest/runner.py` over historical data) to generate metrics.

**NEVER invented numbers are shown here** — this section is honest about the absence.

Metric set: `unified_trading_library.performance_metrics` defines the canonical metric surface (expected: Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, CAGR, Sortino, Calmar, win rate, avg trade PnL). Import was unavailable on this host.
